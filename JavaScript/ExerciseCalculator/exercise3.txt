// Make a Calculator! using prompt(), and variables, make a program that does the following:
// 1. Prompts the user for first number.
// 2. Stores that first number
// 3. Prompts the user for the second number.
// 4. stores that number and responds with the SUM by using an alert.  

var firstNumber = prompt("Enter the first number");
var secondNumber = prompt("Enter the second number");

var typeAction = prompt("Enter a number for the following operation:" + '\n' + "1: Add" + '\n' + "2: Subtract" + '\n' + "3: Multiply" + '\n' + "4: Divide")

if (typeAction === '1') {
  var sum = Number(firstNumber) + Number(secondNumber);
  alert("The sum of both numbers is " + sum);
}
else if (typeAction === '2') {
  var difference = Number(firstNumber) - Number(secondNumber);
  alert("The difference of both numbers is " + difference);
}
else if (typeAction === '3') {
  var product = Number(firstNumber) * Number(secondNumber);
  alert("The prodcut of both numbers is " + product);
}
else if (typeAction === '4') {
  var quotient = Number(firstNumber) / Number(secondNumber);

// BONUS: Make a program that can subtract, multiply, and also divide!
